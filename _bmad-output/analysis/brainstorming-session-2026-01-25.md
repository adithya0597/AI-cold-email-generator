# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** bala
**Date:** 2026-01-25

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Strategic brainstorming for expanding AI Content Generation Suite into a comprehensive AI-powered job search and professional networking platform

**Goals:**
1. Prioritized MVP feature list - what to build first for maximum impact
2. Friction-reducing UX patterns - seamless user experience flows
3. Unique competitive differentiators - what makes this platform stand out
4. Sustainable revenue models - freemium, subscription tiers, B2B angles

### Context Guidance

Based on the codebase analysis (`docs/codebase-analysis.md`):
- **Existing Foundation:** 70% reusable code including FastAPI backend, React frontend, LLM client abstraction, dual-model processing strategy
- **Current Capabilities:** Cold email generation, LinkedIn post generation, author style emulation, web scraping
- **Major Gaps:** H1B research integration, interview prep, resume tailoring, networking CRM, persistent database, user authentication
- **Target Users:** Job seekers (domestic and international including H1B visa holders)

### Session Setup

**Approach Selected:** Progressive Technique Flow
- Start with broad divergent thinking to maximize idea quantity
- Systematically narrow focus through structured convergent techniques
- Ideal for complex multi-goal sessions requiring comprehensive exploration
